    Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
    Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
    You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.

You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
